# Clothing-Brand-Application
A client-server application for a clothing brand based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) developed with object oriented principles.

Python version 3.12
Operating system: Windows 11

Object oriented approach has been used where applicable. Multiple tests have been done with sample txt files. Multithreading tests have been done to see if multiple clients can be run at the same time. Reports have been checked to be correct by comparing with operations.txt and seeing whether expected output is being shown in messagebox.
